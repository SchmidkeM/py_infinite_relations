# infinite-relations

**SUMMARY**
===========
A project for my Bachelor thesis on extending relational algebra by adding infinite tables.

Enables you to create and perform basic relational operations on infinite relations represented by Python generators.

**INSTALLATION & USE**
======================
Can be installed as a package with pip:

*pip install infinite-relations*

Only the core functionality will be installed, no tests or examples.

Otherwise, if you acquired the entire project,
you can run *./examples.py* for a commented guide
or experiment in *./sandbox.py*.

**REQUIREMENTS**
================
- Windows 10+ (tested on Win 10 and 11)
- VS Code (or other IDE) for best experience
(Or just run *examples.py* or *sandbox.py* from cmd.)
- Python 3.10+
