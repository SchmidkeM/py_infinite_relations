# infinite-relations
A project for my Bachelor thesis on extending relational algebra by adding infinite tables.

Enables you to create and perform basic relational operations on infinite relations represented by Python generators.

Can be installed with pip:

**pip install** infinite-relations

Only the core functionality will be installed, no tests or examples.

You can also run and *./examples.py* for a commented guide in console,
or experiment in *./sandbox.py*.
